EXAMPLE USAGE OF G2LOG
=======================
Optional to use either streaming or printf-like syntax
    LOG(INFO) << "Simple to use with streaming syntax, easy as ABC or " << 123;
    or 
    LOGF(WARNING, "Printf-style syntax is also %s", "available");


Conditional logging
    int less = 1; int more = 2
    LOG_IF(INFO, (less<more)) <<"If "<< less<< "<" << more<< ", then this text will be logged";
    or
    LOGF_IF(INFO, (less<more), "if %d<%d then this text will be logged", less,more);


Design-by-Contract
    CHECK(less != more); // true: won't be FATAL
    CHECK(less > more) << "CHECK(false) will trigger a FATAL message, put it on log, then exit";



WHAT IS G2LOG?
====================
In depth information can be found at 
http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/288827/g2log-An-efficient-asynchronous-logger-using-Cplus



Or just read the short summary below:
-------------------------------------

G2log is an asynchronous, "crash safe" logger and design-by-contract library. 
What this means in practice is that 

1. All the slow I/O disk access is done in a background thread. This ensures that the
 other parts of the software can immediately continue with their work after making a log
 entry. 

2. g2log provides logging, Design-by-Contract [#CHECK], and flush of log to file at
 shutdown. Buffered logs will be written to file before the application shuts down.

3. It is thread safe, so using it from multiple threads is completely fine. 

4. It is CRAsH SAFE, in that it will catch certain fatal signals, so if your application
 crashes due to, say a segmentation fault, SIGSEGV,  or some other fatal signals it will
 log and save to file this crash and all previously buffered log entries before exiting.

 
5. It is cross platform. For now, tested on Windows7 ad Ubuntu

6. On Ubuntu a caught fatal signal will generate a stack dump to the log. This is not yet
 available on Windows due to the platforms complexity when traversing the stack. Stack
 dump on Windows will be released later and a beta is available on request. 

7. G2log is used in commercial products as well as hobby projects since early 2011.
The code is given for free as public domain. This gives the option to change, use, and do
 whatever with it, no strings attached.

8. The stable version of g2log is available at https://bitbucket.org/KjellKod/g2log
   The in-development g2log where new features are tried out is available at 
   https://bitbucket.org/KjellKod/g2log-dev ongoing and released features can be seen at

LATEST CHANGES
=====================
2012, Oct 14th
* Complete threadsafe use of localtime for timestamp. (see code: g2time)
* Runtime change of filename, request of filename. (see code g2logwoker g2future)
* Tested on 
  x86 Windows7: Visual Studio 2012 Desktop Express
  x86 Ubuntu 11.04:  gcc 4.7.3
  x64 Ubuntu 12...: gcc 4.7.2
  x64 Windows7: Visual Studio 2012 Professional

  NOTE: It does NOT work with "Visual Studio 11 Beta" (not as C++11 compliant as VS2012)



HOW TO BUILD
===================
This g2log is a snapshot from KjellKod repository. 
It contains what is needed to build example, unit test and performance test of g2log. 

justthread C++11 thread library is no longer needed. 
On Windows it is enough to use Visual Studio 11  (2012)
On Linux it is enough to use gcc4.7.2.  The CMakeFile.txt 
is updated to reflect that, the justthread parts is 
commented away in case someone still needs that.
If you do not have gcc 4.7.2


If you want to integrate g2log in your own software you need 
the files under g2log/src


BUILDING g2log: 
-----------
The default is to build an example binary 'g2log-FATAL'
I suggest you start with that, run it and view the created log also.

If you are interested in the performance or unit tests then you can 
enable the creation of them in the g2log/CMakeLists.txt file. See that file for more details

--- Building on Linux ---
cd g2log
mkdir build
cd build 
cmake ..
make

--- Building on Windows ---
Please use the Visual Studio 11 (2012) command prompt "Developer command prompt"
cd g2log
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G "Visual Studio 11" ..
msbuild g2log_by_kjellkod.sln /p:Configuration=Release
Release\g2log-FATAL.exe


      
CONTENTS
===========================
3rdParty -- gtest, glog. 
-----------------------
Both are needed to compile the unit test and the logger comparison tests
Gtest must be unpacked before used, but it IS included by the CMake and you don't need to do install or compile it in any other way than through the g2log cmake setup.

glog is not included and must be installed if you want to run the comparison tests


About the Active Object
--------------------
Is made with standard C++ components with the help of the latest C++11 and std::thread features (thanks to justthread). For more details see www.kjellkod.cc/active-object-with-cpp0x. An example is provided. Other examples on pre C++0x Active Objects can also be found at www.kjellkod.cc (code page)

If you like it (or not) it would be nice with some feedback. That way 
I can improve g2log and it is also nice to see if someone is using it. 
If you have ANY questions or problems please do not hesitate in contacting
me on my blog http://kjellkod.wordpress.com/2011/11/17/kjellkods-g2log-vs-googles-glog-are-asynchronous-loggers-taking-over/
or at <Hedstrom at KjellKod dot cc>

Good luck :)
